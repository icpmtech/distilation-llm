LLM Distillation Project 🚀

A lightweight and efficient approach to distilling large language models (LLMs) using PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers.

📖 Overview

This project demonstrates knowledge distillation for large language models, where a smaller student model learns from a larger teacher model. This significantly reduces computational cost and memory usage while maintaining high performance.

📌 Features

✅ Train a DistilBERT model from a BERT-base teacher
✅ Implement logit-based distillation with soft targets
✅ Reduce model size and inference time
✅ Use Hugging Face Transformers for training
✅ Configurable training parameters via CLI


---

🚀 Getting Started

1️⃣ Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/icpmtech/distilation-llm.git
cd distilation-llm

2️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment

python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
env\Scripts\activate     # Windows

3️⃣ Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

4️⃣ Train the Distilled Model

Run the training script with configurable hyperparameters:

python main.py --epochs 5 --lr 3e-5

📌 Default settings: epochs=3, lr=5e-5

📊 Performance Comparison

🔹 The distilled model is faster and lightweight while retaining most of the accuracy of the original model.


---

⚙️ Customization

Modify the training settings in main.py:

python main.py --epochs 10 --lr 2e-5

You can also change the distillation temperature and loss function inside train_distillation.py.


---

📌 Next Steps

🔹 Experiment with different student models (e.g., TinyBERT, MobileBERT)
🔹 Fine-tune on a custom dataset
🔹 Convert the distilled model into an ONNX format for deployment

🛠 Troubleshooting

❓ CUDA Out of Memory: Reduce batch size or use torch.cuda.empty_cache()
❓ Slow Training: Run on Google Colab with a GPU
